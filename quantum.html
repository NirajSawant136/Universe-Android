	<h1>Quantum</h1>
	<p>Science never ceases to amaze us. If the galaxies, stars, planets, and the Big Bang weren't sufficient to baffle you, an entire Universe is surrounding you, hidden in plain sight. Welcome to the Quantum World or more amazingly said - Quantum Realm. Quantum Mechanics is currently a celebrity. Everybody loves the word - Quantum. We hear it a lot in many sci-fi movies - quantum entanglement, quantum fluctuations, and lots more. To get an insight into how small this world is, imagine yourself right now, somewhere on this massive planet we call Earth. Imagine if Earth saw itself in a gigantic mirror. Earth wouldn’t observe us, we are minuscule compared to Earth. Earth may not be aware of our existence. Now, place yourself in place of Earth. We know that there are billions of microscopic organisms living on and inside us. When you look at yourself in the mirror, you don’t notice these organisms, they are tiny compared to you. They are literally in front of you, yet you don’t see them. Now, imagine the microscopic organisms in your place, imagine a world so small that these organisms aren’t aware of, that's how small the quantum world is, actually much smaller. Yet it carries within itself the deepest secrets of the Universe.

		So before moving forward with all the wierdness of the quantum world let us understand 'why quantum?'. What made the classical physics inconsistent enough that made scientists to come up with a new physics all together?. We will start with the famous Zeno's Paradox. For those who aren't aware of it, the Zeno's Paradox goes like this - There is a famous althlete named Achilles. He is made to race against a tortoise. The race goes in such manner, the tortoise starts first and gets a head start of x = 100 meters, say. Now, Achilles starts running, by the time he has reached the starting point of tortoise, the tortoise would have covered x/2 = 50 meters. By the time Achilles covers that 50 meters, the tortoise would have covered half that distance, say 25 meters and the tortoise further half of that. Hence we can conclude that Achilles would never be able to catch up with the tortoise and also that both would keep running for eternity and they will never reach the finish line(as you can keep dividing by 2 for eternity). But we know that this is practically impossible, Achilles will in fact take over the tortoise and also they will complete the race. Everything seems right with the paradox as well as reality. So where is the problem arising from?. Have a close look here, if we can keep on dividing by 2 for eternity it eventually also means that both have to complete an infinite number of tasks before reaching the finish line. Well this is where classical mechanics fails. It makes a wrong assumption that you can keep on dividing for eternity. But in reality, there exists a physical limit to how small in length anything can be - the Planck Length(10^(-35) meters). Beyond the Planck Length the concept of 'length' loses its meaning and as smaller and smaller things get, the more bizarre their behaviour become which cannot be predicted by classical mechanics accurately. This was known by the 16th century physicists, the time when people thought there is nothing more in science that is left to uncover. But in fact the physicists knew that the real secrets lied in the microscopic world.

		But the Zeno's Paradox is not how quantum mechanics came into existence, that is a completely different story. No one intentionally made some theories and published them as 'quantum physics'. It is rather a consequence of many events. It all starts with the story of atoms. Early philosophers belived that the entire Universe was made up of four elements - earth, fire, water, and air. They believed that anything can be made using just these four elements, for example, a sword can be forged using earth and fire. But this did not explain the nature or properties of things or helped us predict how they behave. So they came up a new explaination - everything is made up of similar fundamental small particles. They called them atomos meaning extremely small or indivisible. They believed that these were the fundamental blocks of nature and are responsible for eveything around us - trees, mountains, animals. This belief was carried on for centuries until Prof. Ernest Rutherford's famous alpha-particle scattering experiment came. This experiment proved that atoms are infact made of much smaller things. The experiment was conducted as follows - They took an extremely thin gold-foil and passed a ray of alpha-particles(helium ions) through the foil. Now if the foil is made of atoms then all the alpha-particles should reflect back. But the results were different, a majority of the alpha-particles passed thorugh while some reflected back. This showed that atoms are mostly empty space with all its mass concentrated within a tiny space.
