	<h1>Dark Matter/Energ</h1>
	<p>
		We look up at the night sky every day, hordes of stars bathed in everlasting darkness. Why is the Universe so dark?. Most of us think that it is because of empty space between the galaxies, filled with nothing. That makes sense, we do not see anything; it is completely dark. But science never ceases to amaze us, there cannot be a region that has nothing in the Universe. There is always something, and this something is Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Dark Matter is everywhere, literally. Forget about space between galaxies, dark matter is present around you right now. It flows through your body every day. Why don’t you feel it then?. That is because dark matter does not physically interact with you, or anything around you. Matter, as we know it makes up stars, galaxies, earth, plants, trees, rocks, and you. This is what we see and experience in our everyday life. But they account for only 5% of the entire Universe. The rest is Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Dark Matter is around 26% and Dark Energy is about 69%. Both of them are mysterious. We cannot see them, we don't know how to detect them but we know that they exist. It is like knowing all about aquatic animals without having an idea of the water surrounding them. The research on them is very limited. Scientists across the globe make simulations trying to understand their behavior. They do not directly interact with light but their gravitational impact can bend light just like normal objects. So, is Dark Matter a new phase of matter?. We don't know. Dark Matter is literally flowing through you at this very moment. You don't feel it because it does not react with normal matter. Let us dive deep into this darkness.
<br>
<br>
When researchers made some calculations to figure why is the Universe structured the way we see, they found out that there was not enough normal matter in the Universe. The gravity produced by the normal matter was not sufficient enough. If we account for the gravity of the only visible matter, it is so low that galaxies would have faded away long ago. But we still see them, they are pretty intact. There had to be something that helped the formation of galaxies which provided the extra gravity needed to hold them intact. Something dark, hence the name - Dark Matter. We do not have any illustrations or ideas about how they look. We do know what they are not. For starters, they are not antimatter, as antimatter and matter combine to produce unique gamma rays. If they were antimatter, then we would have detected gamma rays till now. They are definitely not black holes, because black holes are compact while dark matter is everywhere. It is dark, meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the Universe to make up the 27% required by the observations. It is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. We know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them. It might be some new particle we have yet to understand, something that doesn’t follow our laws of physics. Dark Matter doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum. It is best at keeping its identity secret. 
<br>
<br>
However, at this point, there are still a few dark matter possibilities that are viable. The baryonic matter could still make up the dark matter if it were all tied up in brown dwarfs or in small, dense chunks of heavy elements. These possibilities are known as massive compact halo objects, or "MACHOs". But the most common view is that dark matter is not baryonic at all, but that it is made up of other, more exotic particles like axions or WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). While it cannot be made up of normal matter — things made of protons, neutrons, and electrons — we do have a known particle that could have the right behavior - Neutrinos. Neutrinos are leftover protons from the Big Bang. At first glance, neutrinos are the perfect dark matter candidate. They barely interact at all with normal matter, and neither absorb nor emit light, meaning that they won't generate an observable signal capable of being picked up by telescopes. They interact with normal matter so feebly that if you had to stop a beam of Neutrinos, even a 5 light-years thick layer of normal matter would not be enough!. At the same time, because they interact through the weak force, the Universe inevitably created enormous numbers of them in the extremely early, hot stages of the Big Bang. Unlike the massless photons, neutrinos may have a non-zero mass. If they have the right value for their mass based on the total number of neutrinos (and antineutrinos) that exist, they could conceivably account for 100% of the dark matter, maybe. So how many neutrinos are there? That depends on the number of types of neutrino. We can see neutrinos that are the result of particle accelerators, nuclear reactors, fusion reactions in the Sun, and cosmic rays interacting with our planet and atmosphere. We can measure their properties, including how they transform into one another, but not the total number of types of neutrino. The total number of types of neutrinos we know today is not sufficient for the Dark Matter eligibility criteria. When we look in detail, the idea of neutrinos is insufficient to make up 100% of the dark matter.
<br>
<br>
Before moving forward, let us understand that dark matter can be categorized into three types - cold, warm, and hot. It has nothing to do with the temperature of dark matter, it rather signifies speed. Cold dark matter has less velocity and hot dark matter has a high velocity. Cold dark matter will cause slower expansion and hot one will cause faster expansion of space. That much is sufficient. The first problem is that neutrinos if they are the dark matter, would be a form of hot dark matter. If dark matter were hot, and moving quickly, it would prevent the gravitational growth of small-scale structure by easily streaming out of it. The fact that we form stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies so early rules this out. The fact that we see the weak lensing signals we do rules this out. The fact that we see the pattern of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background rules this out. And direct measurements of clouds of gas in the early Universe, through a technique known as the Lyman-α forest, definitively rule this out. Dark matter cannot be hot. Only a fraction of the total Dark Matter is allowed to be in form of neutrinos. Given the constraints we have today, we can conclude that approximately 0.5% to 1.5% of the dark matter is made up of neutrinos. This isn't insignificant; the neutrinos in the Universe have about the same mass as all the stars in the Universe. But their gravitational effects are minimal, and they cannot make up the needed dark matter. That just rules out neutrinos.

There is a more likely candidate - Axion. Axions are a solution to a strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics. And yes, researchers are not sure whether they exist. But if they do, they could be the dark matter that we are looking for. And just in case you are confused by the term Quantum Chromodynamics, it is a theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up composite hadrons such as the protons and neutrons. The strong CP problem is a puzzling question in particle physics: Why does quantum chromodynamics (QCD) seem to preserve CP-symmetry?. Okay, back on track. Let us first know what an axion actually is. The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle postulated by the Peccei–Quinn theory in 1977 to resolve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter. Their properties surprisingly satisfy the requirements of Dark Matter. Axions are extremely light-weight. Electron is the lightest known particle which has a mass of 9.1x10^(-34) kg. An axion is a millionth of a millionth times lighter than that! which is about 10^(-12) times lighter. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX), has been searching for axions for the past two decades. As of 2019, no evidence for axions has been seen, but the constraints are better than ever and the experiment is presently being upgraded to search for numerous varieties of axion and axion-like particles. If even a fraction of the dark matter is made of such a particle, ADMX will be the first to discover it directly.
