	<h1>Big Bang</h1>
	<p>
		Our universe. A subtle and wonderful place to live in. When you look at the starry sky every night, the Universe seems quite silent and still. Nothing much seems to happen. Yet it wasn't always like this. We came into this Universe late and missed the very early moments of our Universe. It wasn't around there forever. It also has a life - a beginning and probably an end. Just like we started our lives as a single cell,  the Universe also started as a single entity called  - The Singularity. The name itself suggests - single. What was this Singularity or where it came from, is a mystery and probably will remain so forever. Our current understanding of science isn't sufficient enough to uncover that mystery. Though a lot of efforts are being made. Though we know or at least have an idea of what happened a few moments ( 10^(-32) seconds ) after the Big Bang.
<br>
<br>
Now, you might think - "How do we know all this?". Astronomers combine mathematical models with observations to develop workable theories of how the Universe came to be. They look at the possible outcomes of these mathematical models and devise a hypothesis. Then they make some observations using some instruments. If the observations match with the prediction, then the hypothesis is made into theory. The more experimental pieces of evidence a theory satisfies, the more likely it becomes a law.  There were two models of our Universe. One where the Universe is static and infinite. This model suggests that the Universe has always been there and that it is eternal. Another model suggests that the Universe is expanding and that it had a beginning. The Theory of Big Bang is the workflow of Einstein's general theory of relativity and fundamental particle physics. In 1927, Georges Lemaître stated that an expanding Universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, calling his theory that of the "primeval atom". In the 1920s, a famous astronomer, Edwin Hubble measured the spectra of 18 spiral galaxies with a reasonably well-known distance.  For each galaxy, he could identify a known pattern of atomic spectral lines which all showed a common frequency shift. Using this, he could obtain their velocities with reasonable precision. He concluded that our neighbor galaxies were receding from us. Not only that, but he also observed that galaxies that were farther away from us were receding faster than those near us, this expansion is called the Hubble Flow and the corresponding law is called Hubble's Law. These 2 observations were important evidence for an Ever-expanding Universe. In 1964, US physicist Arno Penzias and radio-astronomer Robert Woodrow Wilson discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background by accident, popularly known as CMB. It was the leftover radiation from the Big Bang. It was then that Big Bang became the accepted theory of the Origin of the Universe. Hence, now we know that our Universe indeed had a beginning just like us.
<br>
<br>
The Universe is 13.8 billion years old and a lot has happened since it's birth. And a lot happened in just 1 second after the Big Bang. The essential ingredients were prepared in this period. After 10^(-43) seconds of Big Bang, our little Universe was intensely hot. It might have been around billions of degrees Celcius. Space was expanding, though there was literally nothing surrounding the Universe, we can say that Space was expanding into itself. The Universe has no boundary. This was the Planck Era or the Planck Epoch, the Universe was so hot, around 10^(32) degree Celcius (the Planck Temperature) that the four fundamental forces known today might have been unified as a single force. At this point, the universe spans a region of only 10^(-35) meters i.e, one Planck Length. Then comes the Grand Unification Epoch,  from 10^(–43) seconds to 10^(–36) seconds. The force of gravity separates from the other fundamental forces (which remain unified), and the earliest elementary particles and antiparticles begin to be created. Then comes the Inflationary Epoch, from 10^(–36) seconds to 10^(–32) seconds. Triggered by the separation of the strong nuclear force, the universe undergoes an extremely rapid exponential expansion, known as cosmic inflation. The linear dimensions of the early Universe increase during this period of a tiny fraction of a second by a factor of at least 10^(26) to around 10 centimeters (about the size of a grapefruit). The elementary particles remaining from the Grand Unification Epoch (a hot, dense quark-gluon plasma, sometimes known as “quark soup”) become distributed very thinly across the Universe.
<br>
<br>
Enter the Electroweak Epoch, from 10^(–36) seconds to 10^(–12) seconds. As gravity had departed from the family of fundamental forces, it was now time for the Strong Nuclear Force to leave. This departure caused particle interactions to create large numbers of exotic particles, including W and Z bosons and Higgs bosons. For now, just understand that Higgs bosons give you mass. It is because of them that we can talk about 'Weight' in the first place. The Higgs bosons create Higgs field, particles like electrons and protons react with these fields which slows them down, thus giving them and indirectly us 'mass'. They allowed a Universe made entirely out of radiation to support things that have mass. Now comes the Quark Epoch. In this Era, energy manifested itself into tiny particles that existed for only a short period. They were called as Gluons. These gluons fused with other gluons to forms pairs of quarks. These pairs of quarks were unstable as the Universe was very hot at that time. They destroyed one another in matter-antimatter collisions. The temperature was so hot that matter and energy were basically the same stuff. The massive war between matter and antimatter continued for a short period leaving around a billion matter particles for every antimatter particle. The Matter particles won the war. The Universe was dominated by matter particles. But matter is only around 5 percent of the Universe. The rest is Dark Matter and Dark Energy. These two make up the empty space in the Universe. And yes, they are a mystery too. Around 10^(-9) seconds after the Big Bang, the Universe had expanded roughly a few billions of kilometers across. The Universe started to cool down. This is when the four known fundamental forces were born. Gravity, Electromagnetism, Strong Nuclear, and Weak Nuclear Force. Gravity is the weakest yet dominant amongst them. These fundamental forces together shaped the Universe we know today. 
 <br>
<br>
Around 0.01 seconds after the Big Bang, quarks started to form new particles - Hadrons and Leptons. These were like protons. This was the Hadron&Lepton Era. Quarks formed many different types of Hadrons and Leptons but only a few were stable enough to continue their journey. Our 1 second is completed by now. So much happened within this 1 second yet there is more to know. After this comes the Nucleosynthesis Era. By now the Universe had expanded around 100 billion kilometers across. There is sufficient space for particles to cool down to form the very first element - Hydrogen. A single electron around a single proton. Though we see them revolving around protons in many depictions. But that isn't the case, they are present somewhere within the atom around the proton, not necessarily revolving.
<br>
<br>
Then came the Opaque Era after about 200 seconds after the Big Bang. Hadrons and electrons started forming atoms, nothing till this time was visible as the dense cloud didn't allow light to escape also there was no one around to see. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived hydrogen atoms could not scatter the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque cloud.
<br>
<br>
There is another possible model of the Universe. In this model, the Universe is expanding like the second model. But it will reach a peak point after expanding for some billions of years and then will begin to collapse and finally end in an event popularly known as 'The Big Crunch'. This is a possible explanation of how our Universe might have born. A Universe collapsed in a Big Crunch event and became a singularity, which in turn resulted in the Big Bang which created our Universe. Hence, a conclusion could be based on this model that this cycle of Big Bang and Big Crunch continues for infinity. This model became so popular that we started looking for 'White Holes'. A White Hole is a hypothetical astronomical object which instead of sucking in matter and light like a Black Hole does, it ejects enormous amounts of light and matter. Yes, it is very disturbing. We haven't found any pieces of evidence of them yet, but we are still looking. 
<br>
<br>
But while we were searching for White Holes, we found a new fascinating object which we thought were White Holes. Quasars were discovered. But before diving in, we need to know some scientific terms. The first one is Apparent Magnitude, it refers to the brightness of any object in the sky as seen from Earth. The less the value, the brighter the object. The apparent magnitude of the Sun is -26.74, that of Full Moon is -12.92 and that of a distant star VY Canis Majoris is -4.89. The second is Absolute Magnitude, it refers to the actual or true brightness of any object in the Universe. The absolute magnitude of Sun is 4.83, that of VY Canis Majoris is -9.4 and that of the Moon is 'NA' as it has no light of its own. The brightest star ever to be discovered, R136a1 has an absolute magnitude of -12.6. Now, to put this into perspective, VY Canis Majoris is 3,900 light-years or 36,894 trillion kilometers away from Earth and R136a1 is 163,000 light-years or  1,541,980 trillion kilometers away. Despite R136a1 being 40 times farther away, it is around 30 times more brighter than VY Canis Majoris!. R136a1 is not even in our galaxy, it is present in a satellite galaxy called The Large Magellanic Cloud. R136a1 is so bright that if you replaced our Sun with it, Earth would have to be around 400 times farther away than its current distance from Sun, to sustain life as we know now!.
<br>
<br>
But this nothing compared to quasars. The absolute magnitude of the first detected quasar '3C 273', was -26.7 making it around 4,000,000,000,000( 4 trillion ) times brighter than our Sun and around 100 times more brighter than the total amount of light produced by our Milky Way!. If you put 3C-273 33 light-years away from us, then it would shine as bright as our Sun!. Imagine that!. But what makes quasars so bright?. Quasars were formed in the very early stages of the Universe, a few millions of years after the Big Bang.  They are actually galaxies with an Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ). As the name suggests, AGN refers to a highly active galactic center. The black holes at the center at extremely active, sucking in enormous amounts of material. This material spins around black holes in disks know as Accretion Disks. In quasars, these accretion disks spin very rapidly, the friction thus created in these disks leads to massive to rise in temperatures. This results in the AGN projecting this extra material into space in the form of long jets of energy. The lengths of these jets are around 9 quadrillion kilometers long!. But what if these jets directly pointed at us?. Well, in that case, such a quasar is called 'Blazar'. Blazar 3C454.3 was recorded to have an absolute magnitude of -31.6, the highest brightness recorded ever. For a black hole to become a quasar, it must consume at least 600 Earths worth of matter every minute or 10 stars every year, until it becomes large enough that it swallows the stars whole instead of tearing them down and forming an accretion disk. The back holes at the center of Quasars are a lot smaller than the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies. A very famous illustration of the accretion disk around a black hole was made in the movie 'Interstellar' near the black hole called 'Gargantua'. Quasars are a couple of billions of light-years away which means light from them took billions of years to reach us. The Universe is 13.8 billion years old, which means Quasars are dead by now. What we see in the sky is just a glimpse of the past. How wonderful our Universe really is, the brightest phenomenon is caused by the darkest things in the Universe.

But wait, there is more to come. The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was the most crucial part of all this. It was the most important evidence that helped us conclude that the Big Bang, in fact, was real and the CMBR is the living proof of it. But what exactly is Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation?. By definition, it is the remnant electromagnetic radiation from an early stage of the Universe, also called as 'Relic Radiation'. The name itself says it, 'Cosmic Background'. But why specifically, microwave?. The radiation over billions of years has redshifted to the Microwave region of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, which is in range of 3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm. In a few million years or so, the radiation will redshift even more. Then the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation will become Cosmic Radiowave Background Radiation and eventually it will redshift so much that we wont be able to detect them. We are at the right moment to observe it. But how does it connects specifically to Big Bang?. Well, if we considered the first model where our Universe is static and eternal also called The Steady State Model. In this case, there is no possibility of any 'Background Radiation'. But thanks to Hubble, his research proved that the Universe isn't static. The idea of a static Universe was dumped. Which leaves us with a non-static Universe. If we traced back the movement of galaxies, we can conclude that everything must have been at the same point in space, hence the singularity and following it comes the Big Bang. The CMB essentially confirms the Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned that if there was a big bang, the expansion of the Universe would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and down to a temperature of about 5 K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there. The CMB gives a snapshot of the Universe when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow electrons and protons to form hydrogen atoms, thereby making the universe nearly transparent to radiation because light was no longer being scattered off free electrons. When it originated some 380,000 years after the Big Bang—this time is generally known as the "time of last scattering" or the period of recombination or decoupling—the temperature of the Universe was about 3000 K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.26 eV, which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen.

Quasars are one of the many wonders that are hidden in the vastness of our Universe. But wait, this isn't the end. One very important factor is yet to be answered. Is the expansion uniform? We all have heard that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Space is expanding faster than the speed of light. This is true and brings us to the concept of 'Observable Universe'. The Observable Universe is a spherical region of the Universe comprising all matter that can be observed from Earth or its space-based telescopes and exploratory probes at the present time because electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time to reach the Solar System and Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the Observable Universe. Assuming the Universe is uniform in all directions, the distance to the edge of the Observable Universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer. Your Observable Universe and your friend's Observable Universe sitting next to you isn't the same, though the difference is negligible, each one of you being the center of your own Observable Universes. The word observable in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect light or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the speed of light itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light simply cannot be detected, as the signals could not have reached us yet. The galaxies outside the Observable Universe are lost to us forever. The radius of the Observable Universe is about 46.5 billion light-years. The total mass of ordinary matter of the Observable Universe to be about 1.5 × 10^(53) kg. So, a time will come when our observable universe would become empty. Future civilizations would stare at the night sky and see no galaxies. Though we will always have our galaxy. Our own galaxy is so massive that we dont actually need travelling to distant galaxies. Our Milky Way has about 300 billion stars. Out of them, aorund a billion are our Sun-like stars. So open your eyes and look towards the skies, and realize your place in the Universe...
