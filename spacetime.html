		What is time?. We percieve time every passing second yet what it is or even if it really exists are both very strong questions. This is one of the most complicated and widely misunderstood concept in science. Why so?. Take a lemon for example, you know what a lemon looks like, you have felt it by physically touching it. You know that when you slice it open, it has these symmetrical structures and also that when you squeeze it, it ejects out citric acid. When someone asks you what a lemon is, you can explain with no doubt. But take 'Time', you only came to know about it when someone told you. Uptil then, you were completely unaware of it. You only realize what time it is when you think about it. You never physically touched it, so you can't be sure of its existence. So describing something that you never touched (physically interacted with) or never saw is somewhat difficult. You may explain well, but there will always be a doubt in some or other manner. Let us try to understand what time really is.

		By the time you reached this paragraph, about 20 to 30 seconds have passed, we are always told - 'Time never stops for anybody, it keeps flowing'. Does it really?. Imagine you are walking towards your home and all of sudden time stops(due to some reasons). Well, now as time has stopped, so have you stopped and everything around you, like a snapshot. Now time starts again and you continued from where you were. You wouldn't realize that time had stopped because you weren't consicous at that time. You would never know. For simplicity, time is considered to be unidirection - that it only flows in one direction. We can explain in analogy with river. There is a river flowing downstream, you make a paper boat and release it in the river. Your boat flows in the direction of river. Stop the flow of river(if you can!) and the boat stops. Same is the case with time, we are the boat and time is the river. We flow in the direction of time. Here is where things get a bit complicated. See, in case of river you know what it is, you have seen it, touched it. With sufficient technology you can divert the direction of river, maybe even slow it down. But we dont know what time actually is, we cannot control it or change its course. If we knew that, well we would be time-travellers by now. Take another analogy, you are in a elevator, whose height is about your height and has no controls in it, so you cannot decide where you want to go. So we assume the elevator goes up and also let us assume that elevator goes endlessly. Once the elevator starts it would continue to move up and all you can do is, well you can do nothing. The elevator can only be stopped if someone outside the elevator powers it off. This is another explaination, we are 3 dimensional being, we can percieve the world in 3 dimensions of space - up-down, left-right and front-back. Time as a dimension is hidden from us. In the case of elevator, you could move front-back and left-right direction. The up-down direction was hidden from you, you only felt that you were going up but couldn't do anything about it. But someone outside the elevator who had access to up-down direction could control it. Some researchers think that a 4 or higher dimensional being could percieve time as a physical dimension, that they could physically touch time. It might just like moving up-down, left-right or front-back, something which is impossible for our brains to grasp. Moving through time for such beings might just be like moving up and down a mountain. This concept of time is depicted in the movie 'Interstellar' in its final scenes. Why can't our brains grasp it then?. During our stages of evolution, our ancestors never faced any problems where they had to face an extra dimension, so our brains never evolved taking an extra dimension into consideration. The 3 dimensions were sufficient. Everything was fine without it. But this is all just theory, we have no idea if any of this is true.

		Well, if the concept of time is so bizarre, why dont we just throw it off. We cannot, the entire science relies on it. In the analogy of river, the concept of river flowing in one direction helped you predict where the boat would be after a while and also is responsible for floating of boat in first place. Same is with time, the unidirection property of time, helps us predict behaviour of objects ranging from a rolling ball to planetary motion.
