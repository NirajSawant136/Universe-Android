	<h1>Earth</h1>
	<p>
A pale blue dot. Yet an entire Universe in itself. It came into existence 9 billion years after the Big Bang, the birth of The Universe. We have lived here for a long time and have explored this blue dot to its most beauty and immenseness. We adore this blue dot because this blue dot is all we have got. We gaze at other dots in the night sky and mesmerize. Every dot being an entire Universe on its own. We call this blue dot - Our Home, Our Earth. As your life started as a single cell, earth started its life as a bare rock. It was very hot, thousands of degree Celcius. But how did earth form?. Simple, gravity. It formed from the stardust present around the Sun. To demonstrate this, take a card-board. Make a hole in the center to fit a pin tightly. Take multiple strings and attach their one end to the pin and another end to a magnet. Now rotate the board with sufficient speed keeping the pin as center and observe. Notice how the magnets move in circular motion around the pin. In the same way, the stardust also moved around the Sun in orbits. Slowly and gradually, two magnets collide and get attached to each other due to magnetism. In the same way, rocks in the stardust collided and fused under gravity. After sometime, all the magnets attach and form a single magnet. In similar manner, all rocks collided and formed a single big rock, Earth. Other planets were formed in similar manner. Somewhere around that time, a Mars-sized body called Theia collided with Earth, scattering some of earth's mass into a orbit around earth. This debris fused in a similar manner forming another body, a natural satellite of Earth - The Moon. We all know that Earth is a planet. But what is a planet?. This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things. First, it must orbit a star. Second, it must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. Third, it must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of similar size near its orbit around the Sun. Let us break this down one by one. The first condition is obvious and a consequence of how planets form. The second condition is more of a mathematics-based concept. Given all possible 3D-shapes, a sphere is the one with least surface area. The third one comes from a simple observation. You have seen many illustrations of the Solar System. Have you noticed what all planets share in common?. There is nothing else on the orbit of a planet than the planet itself (the moons it carries are a part of it). In a way, the body should be big enough that its gravity either kicked off or swallowed any other body in its orbit. This is the reason why Pluto is not considered a planet. It satisfies the first two conditions, it orbit the Sun and it has spherical shape like other planets do. However its orbit is inhabited by members of the Kuiper Belt and Pluto's gravity isn't enough to kick them off its orbit. Rather Pluto is considered as a member of the Kuiper Belt. Kuiper Belt is just like the Asteroid Belt, populated by rocks of all sort, located outside Neptune. That was pretty much what planet are. But wait, we are missing something. Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula. Planets are formed much like how stars are formed. Hot, dense matter clumps together to form luminous celestial bodies known as Stars. Smaller clumps of matter around these stars form planets. Then why don't planets burn as stars do?. That is because for a celestial body to become a star, it must be at least 80 times more massive than Jupiter ( 1.9x10^27 kg ) to carry out Thermonuclear reactions. That is only 8 percent of our Sun's mass, but it is enough. So planets are 'Failed Stars'. Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago and humans have existed for only 2 million years. Which means we are missing more than 4 billion years of earth!. Let us cover up.

<br>
<h1>The Rock</h1>
<br>
<p>
As we talking about earth's history, let us understand one thing - Rocks. That makes sense, earth is a rock. To understand Earth we first need to understand rocks. What is a rock?. By definition, a rock is any naturally occuring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. Simply said, rock is bunch of minerals pilled up together. So what are minerals?. A mineral is composition of basic elements like iron, calcium, magnesium, etc. For example, Iron(Fe), Ni(Nickel), and Si(Silicon) combine to form a mineral known as Mackinawite. Yet the properties of minerals differ a lot from that of their ingredients. Rocks seem very simple and lifeless, yet they tell great tales about our world. The infant earth was a hot playground. Space wasn't silent yet, there were a lot of rocks floating around and a few gave a visit to earth. This was the Heavy Bombardment Period. The temperature of earth remained at high levels, thanks to these new guests. Some researchers estimate that these outisiders gifted us around 250 minerals as a jump start. Today, more than 5000 minerals are known to exist. The earth was black at start, with heavy elements colliding and binding together. Dense material sank to the center, while the lighter material created the crust, the same way a stone sinks in water while a feather floats on it. The planet's magnetic field probably formed around this time. Though the real reason of the magnetic field is still a topic of debate amongst scientists. As these rocks fused together under gravity, their temperatures increased and they began to melt. This is when the three layers of earth - The Crust, The Mantle and The Core began to form. The core was the most dense as it was crushed by all rocks above it, making it red hot. A bit cooler was a layer above it, the mantle. The flow of the mantle beneath the crust causes plate tectonics, the movement of the large plates of rock on the surface of the Earth. Collisions and friction gave rise to mountains and volcanoes, which began to spew gases into the atmosphere and gravity captured some of the gases that made up the planet's early atmosphere. Collisions from the outsiders likely deposited much of the Earth's water on its surface. Because the planet is in the Goldilocks zone(or The Habitable Zone), the region where liquid water neither freezes nor evaporates but can remain as a liquid, the water remained at the surface, which many scientists think plays a key role in the development of life. This is called the Core Accretion Model, which describes how rocky planets like earth form. According to NASA, core accretion suggests that small, rocky worlds should be very common . But there are other forms of planets called - The Gas Giants like Jupiter, and Saturn.  These are mostly gas with a relatively smaller cores. Their formation is explained by an another model - The Disk Instability Model. According to this model, clumps of dust and gas are bound together early in the life of the solar system. Over time, these clumps slowly compact into a giant planet. 
<br>
<br>
Okay, back to rocks. All this gave earth few rocks to play around. The stage has been set up now, Crust is ready, we have a hot core, volcanoes, and most importantly - rocks. Let us begin the show. The insides of earth were tremendously hot. They were spewed out and intoduced to surface by the volcanoes. Here they cooled as temperatures were lower than insides. They cooled and formed the first rock - Basalt. Around 90% of volcanic rocks on earth is Basalt which makes them the likely candidate. Basalt lava has a low viscosity(flows easily), due to its low silica content, resulting in rapid lava flows that can spread over great areas before cooling and solidification. This caused vast deposits in some regions making what know now as - Land. Rocks are made of minerals. So, of what minerals is Basalt made of?. Basalt is rich in Iron and Magnesium. Before moving ahead, let us answer one question - Why are minerals so important?. Minerals are building blocks of modern civilization. From hammering-nails to rockets, nothing is possible without minerals. Iron mineral is used in the manufacturing steel, water faucets, microwaves and televisions. The mineral aluminum is commonly used in the construction and computer industries, and in the manufacturing of cars and airplanes, and also as thin foils to keep your food warm. Copper is valuable for its use in the manufacturing of industrial equipment and is also used throughout the transportation industry. Throughout history, copper has been used in the making of coins for currency. Technology would not be what it is today without the use of the mineral silica. Perhaps its most well-known use is in the making of computer chips. Silica is used in electronic devices such as cameras, cell phones, clocks, GPS and all types of computers. Silica also is used in the making of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food products. Minerals are everywhere which makes them an essential component in the Origin of Life. Life and rocks have co-evolved through ages. There is as much diversity in rocks as there in life. The most obvious reasons are - Fossils. Remains of organic life embedded in rocks. How is this true?. Well, picture this. We all agree that earth is a giant rock on which you, a living creature lives, evolves and prospers. Earth provides you with all the resources you need. In turn you also have an impact on earth in both good and bad ways. Earth has changed since the coming of humans. Same is the case with normal rocks, actually rocks aren't normal. Zoom into them and you see all sorts of beautiful and colorful patterns you probably never expected to see. (Give some examples). These landscapes provide a playground for life to evolve and grow. Slice these rocks and they can unveil the mysterious origin of life. So how did life originate?. Let us uncover the mystery. But before that let us see what geologist have for us. They have divided the history of earth in different eons. The Hadean eon represents the time before a reliable (fossil) record of life; it began with the formation of the planet and ended 4.0 billion years ago. The following Archean and Proterozoic eons produced the beginnings of life on Earth and its earliest evolution. The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic, divided into three eras: the Palaeozoic, an era of arthropods, fishes, and the first life on land; the Mesozoic, which spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs; and the Cenozoic, which saw the rise of mammals. Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale. This helps us to seggregate the history of earth and understand things step by step. So, let us begin at the beginning. 
</p>
<br>
<h1>Origin of Life</h1>
<br>
<p>
There is a very famous theory often correlated with the origin of Life - Abiogenesis. This theory states that life arose from non-life. Definitely, life cannot simply pop into existence. Abiogenesis relates to a period between the Hadeon Eon and the Archean Eon, around 3.8 billion years ago. Life came into existence at this time. Abiogenesis suggests to us that life came into existence from a puddle of chemicals. It is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. While the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity. So, something happened and the simplest form of life was created. What happened?. Elements and compounds essential for life include Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Ammonia, Nitrogen, and Phosphates. For these elements to react and mingle with each other, they need a solvent, in this case, water. And in order to grow and reproduce, they need energy. Life forms are divided into two categories- The Autotrophs and The Heterotrophs. Autotrophs generate their own energy, like plants. Heterotrophs, consume autotrophs to get energy, like us. The first life forms wouldn't have had any other organisms to consume, so they must have been Autotrophs. They might have generated energy from the Sun or a chemical gradient. Before going further know one small fact - They most basic elements that are found common in all things that have life are the Amino Acids. The so called 'Building Blocks of Life'. Once we how they originated, we would have pretty much figured out the origin of life. That makes sense, each organ in your body works and is 'alive' only because of some chemicals mingling with each other. In 1950s a very famous experiment was conducted by biochemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey which demonstrated that several organic compounds could be formed spontaneously by simulating the conditions of Earth's early atmosphere. The experiment was simple, in one flask they had some gases which simulated the Earth's primordial atmosphere and in another they had water simulating the 'puddle'. After adding a spark of electricity which simulated source of energy(or something that initiated the reactions), they ran the experiment. And the results were astonsishing, some organic compunds including amino acids formed in the water. This experiment went so viral that newspaper had them published as 'Life Made In Laboratory'. This explains a lot but there is one puzzling question yet to be answered. The spark of electricity simulates sunlight, but notice one thing. There was no ozone layer around that time, so all sunlight was UV. That might not be favorable for life. So is this experiment a failure?. No, we just need to change our location. There is more suitable place that researchers found - Underwater. That makes sense, earth is two-thirds water and there is lot diversity in aquatic life than in terrestial life. The first life probably would have been aquatic. The tiniest and the largest species are both aquatic. The answer lies in the Hydrothermal Vents on the ocean floors. A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in Earth's crust, where seawater seeps into magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures, along with a rich slurry of minerals and chemical compounds like Iron, Calcium, and Silicon. Energy is particularly concentrated in the steep chemical gradients of hydrothermal vents. When geologists researched this hydrothermal vents they found out that they provide just the right conditions for life to start. We have our solvent - water, source of energy from the vents and also some rich deposits of minerals. All this brings us to the first living organism - LUCA(Last Universal Common Ancestor). LUCA is ancestor to us all but it is not the first organism. But all life that we see today are derived from LUCA. We don't know how LUCA looked like, there are no LUCA fossils or any modern-day LUCA still around. Instead, scientists identified genes that are commonly found in species across all three domains of life that exist today - Archae, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Since these genes are shared across all these domains, they must share a common ancestor - LUCA. These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient, like the ones at hydrothermal vents. But wait how can oceans be 'oxygen-free'?. Note that at early stages of earth, iron was widespread in water bodies. Free oxygen wasn't available yet. There are two kinds of hydrothermal vents, black smokers and white smokers. Black smokers are heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius and release sulphur, iron, copper and other metals essential for life. Black smokers were too hot for LUCA. So, our likely candidates are White Smokers. A field of hydrothermal vents across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge called 'The Lost City' has become the most favored candidate for LUCA. The seawater expelled here is highly alkaline and lacks carbon dioxide, but is rich in Methane and offers more hospitable conditions. Adjacent black smokers may have contributed carbon dioxide that helped life to evolve in the Lost City, giving it all the essential components to support the first organisms that expanded into the incredible diversity of life we see today. 
<br>
<br>
But this does not explain how complex life, such as humans, came into existence. That credit goes to an organism that almost destroyed all life on Earth in its early stages. It caused the first mass extinction in Earth's history and even paved the way for complex life. They are called Cyanobacteria(formerly known as blue-green algae), actually their ancestors. These were single-celled organisms with no organelle, not even nuclei. At that time, the atmosphere was devoid of oxygen. In the oceans, life manifested in the form of tiny Anaerobic organisms. Anaerobic organisms unlike us don't need oxygen to survive and thanks to basalt, oceans were rich in iron at that time. Amongst them were The Cyanobacteria. But somewhere around 2.5 to 3.5 billion years ago, some of them evolved a new ability - Photosynthesis. It allowed them to harness energy using sunlight and allowed them to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and sugars. This gave them an evolutionary advantage over others, and they multiplied in millions. They released the oxygen produced as a by-product into the atmosphere. Soon, the atmosphere was filled with oxygen. Millions of years later, because of increasing number of cyanobacteria oxygen content exploded so much that it became one of the major parts of atmosphere. This was bad news for the anaerobic organisms. The oxygen combined with the iron in oceans to form rust which made oceans nearly inhabitable. Oxygen-rich air was toxic to them. About 2.5 billion years ago, there was a mass extinction of almost all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this the 'Great Oxygenation Event' or the 'Oxygen Catastrophe'. 
<br>
<br>
But there was worse to come. Up until this time, the atmosphere was devoid of the new member. But as oxygen abundances increased, some of it combined with methane to create carbon dioxide. Methane is a far more efficient greenhouse gas than CO2, and this methane was keeping the planet warm. As methane levels dropped, the Earth cooled. This triggered a massive glaciation event, a global ice age that made earth a giant ice ball. This is called the Huronian Glaciation. Things got so bad the cyanobacteria themselves were threatened. Their own numbers dropped, along with nearly all other life on Earth. The mass extinction that followed was vast. But there was an exception - some organisms could use that oxygen in their own metabolic processes. Combining oxygen with other molecules can release energy, a lot of it, and that energy is useful. It allowed these microscopic plants to grow faster, breed faster. The anaerobic species died off, falling to the oxygen-burning plants, which prospered in this new environment. Certainly, anaerobes didn’t vanish from the Earth, but they were vanquished to low-oxygen environments such as the bottom of the ocean. They were no longer the dominant form of life on Earth. Eventually, over a few hundred million years, Earth warmed up again, though not as hot as it used to be. Aerobic organisms absorbed the extra oxygen in the atmosphere over time until it reached a concentration of 21 percent that it is today. And being able to use the chemical power of oxygen, they were able to evolve into more complex forms. Hundreds of million years ago, some other prehistoric microbe swallowed a cyanobacteria whole in a process called Endosymbiosis. It used the cyanobacteria's power of photosynthesis to make its own energy factories. We have learned about them by their name- Chloroplasts. This was the ancestor of our plant cells. Thus, cyanobacteria become chloroplasts. Life as we know now wouldn't exist without Cyanobacteria. So thank them. 
<br>
<br>
But how rocks are associated with all this. Well the answer lie with the Stromatolites - Greek for ‘layered rock’ – are microbial reefs created by cyanobacteria. Stromatolite deposits are formed by sediment trapping and binding, and/or by precipitation activities of the microbial communities. The microbes are active on the surface layer of the Stromatolites, while the underlying build-up is a lithified remnant of former microbial surface communities, that could be interpreted as a trace-fossil. These stromatolites acted as surfaces where the cyanobacteria could survive and by photosynthesis produce oxygen. These are layer over layer of primordial cyanobacteria. Stromatolites and their close cousins the thrombolites, are rock-like buildups of microbial mats that form in limestone- or dolostone-forming environments. Together with oncoids (formerly called "algal biscuits" or "Girvanella"), they typically form by the baffling, trapping, and precipitation of particles by communities of microorganisms such as bacteria and algae. In some cases, they can form inorganically, for example when seawaters are oversaturated with certains chemicals resulting in precipitation. Stromatolite-building communities include the oldest known fossils, dating back some 3.5 billion years when the environments of Earth were too hostile to support life as we know it today. Living Stromatolites are no longer widely distributed. There are only two well-developed marine Stromatolite areas in the world: in the Bahamas and at Hamelin Pool in the Shark Bay area of Western Australia. Hamelin Pool is home to the most extensive living Stromatolite system in the world: the organisms thrive in the area’s hypersaline water, which is twice as salty as normal seawater. But this only the case of early simple life. But what about complex life like us, how are rocks associated with us?. There are literal rocks inside you. Take your teeth for example, ever wondered why it is so hard?. It helps you crunch down all sorts of delicious foods. That is possible because your teeth is actually a mineral called Hydroxyapatite. It is composition of calcium, phosphorous and other minerals. Your bones are actually rocks, minerals to be more precise. Let us break this rock-life coherence mystery. There are basically two types of animals- predators and preys. What are the basic requirements for a animal to be either a predator or a prey?. A predator needs to be fast and strong enough to catch and incapacitate its prey. The prey needs some kind of shielding or advantage over the predators. For a predator to be fast, it needs to have a rigid body, stiff enough to carry the weight of the predator while maintaining speed. So what is a natural occuring rigid material - rocks definitely which ultimately lead us to bones. To incapacitate the prey it needs to do some sort of physical damage to the prey. It needs something sharp and strong, which again introduces rocks leading us to claws and teeth. Tigers, lions, panthers are very common examples. Now come to the prey, it also needs rigidity to have more speed. But just in case speed is not an advantage, it needs some shielding. Rocks can provide such shielding, very commonly examples are shells of snails and tortoise. Having a shield protects them from predators. While inside their shells, tortoise look just like other rocks which fools the predators. We weren't possible without rocks. This is only one side, how are rocks benefitted by life?. 
<br>
<br>
That was quite fascinating. How nature works!. The past has been full of amazing natural processes that shaped this pale blue dot into a Universe in itself. But what is a Natural Process in real?. We hear them a lot, but most of us don’t know what it really is. We will dive deep and try to give you a clear insight.
</p>
<br>
<h1>Evolution of Life</h1>
<br>
<p>
Einstein once said - “God doesn’t play dice”. That might be true. But our world does not have any God, nobody plays dice to decide events in the Universe. The Universe plays by Science. Tiny, mindless and stupid things come together to form something meaningful. This is called ‘Emergence’. It describes small things forming bigger things and having different properties than the sum of their parts. Emergence refers to complexity arising from simplicity. This is a property rooted in the Universe and even our Nature. Atoms make molecules, molecules make complex compounds, complex compounds make cells, cells together make organs, organs together make an organism like you. Atoms have no purpose, no desire, they just interact with one another under certain laws of physics. Cells are stupid, they just exchange messages with their neighbors via chemicals. All they know is just how to respond to a particular message. They aren’t aware of themselves. They just do it. There is no Master-mind in the Universe, things just happen. One of the best examples is water. A single water molecule doesn’t do much, just one oxygen atom attached to two hydrogen atoms. But in bulk, they form liquid water, clouds, glaciers, oceans. The Earth is blue because of them. They made us possible. But they never intended to do any of these. In a way, we can say that Chemistry is an emergent property of atomic physics. Biology is an emergent property of Chemistry. Atoms combine with other atoms under the laws of physics. Following these laws, atoms combine to form molecules. We study the interactions of these molecules in Chemistry, and Biology finally studies how collective interactions of a different group of molecules help our body to function. This might not be 100% true, but it is likely to be so. What about physics?. Physics is an emergent property of the fabric of Space-Time and Mathematics helps define relations amongst them. This property of Emergence is present everywhere in the Universe. Life is an emergent property of Nature.
<br>
<br>
All things are in the Universe, and the Universe is in all things: we in it, and it in us; in this way, everything concurs in perfect unity. - Giordano Bruno
<br>
<br>
Our Nature is an emergent property of the Universe. Now, that’s something!. No Master-Controller is controlling the natural processes you see every day, its Emergence. You probably might have heard about the famous ‘Theory of Evolution’ by Darwin. This is a very interesting phenomenon and can be explained with the Emergence property of the Universe very well. Let us dive in. Humans have evolved from monkeys, but if that is true, then why are there monkeys still hopping around?. We see many illustrations of monkeys slowly evolving and ultimately becoming us, the Homo Sapiens. We are not monkeys, we are fish. Monkeys just share a common ancestor with us. We are not the final goal of Evolution; just a by-product of evolution that happened to evolve complex brains. How does evolution work?. Simply, evolution is natural selection; random mutations happen in any species and a new species is born which is slightly better than old ones, they survive while the old ones go extinct just because they were not able to cope up with Nature’s demands. This ‘Natural Selection’ seems some supernatural force governing what is best. But it all boils down to the Emergence property. Mutations occur purely based on laws of Chemistry, but deep within there is still Physics. Imagine you gave a bunch of toys to 100 two-year old kids. These toys are of geometrical shape - circle, triangle, square, and so on. Each piece is identical in dimensions. You want to prepare a square grid, so only square-shaped toys can be used. But telling to do so to a 2-year-old kid is somewhat difficult. So, you let the kids play and nothing of a surprise, the kids place the toys randomly. Now maybe out of 100 kids 10 were successfully able to make square grid. They made it without realizing anything, they just placed toys at random and ended up with what you wanted. So they recieved a candy from you while others didn't and they enjoyed the candy without realizing that they actually won something. Evolution work almost similar. Random mutations happen in an organism. These mutations may occur due to change in habitat or climate. Some mutations help the organism to survive in this new climate while some make it worse. Mutations can be thought of any changes in the chemical structure of the organism. Different mutations occur in all individuals of a species and those with helpful mutations survive and reproduce while those with bad ones die. But how does this happen?. Think of it like this, a catastrophe occurs in a native habitat of giraffes which leads to decrease in number of tall trees in that region. Giraffes are known for the long necks, so feeding on small trees is somewhat difficult for them. Those giraffes who had bit smaller necks where able to feed well on smaller trees and survived while those with longer necks suffered from poor health due to starvation. Those who survived, reproduced to produce more like them which ultimaetely lead to giraffes having smaller necks(though that is not a real case, it is just an example). Nothing made this happen, it all just came to be. A lot of random events occured which led our ancestors to becoming us. Though this process is very slow as it is completely random. Though we have figured out how the changes occur but where do the changes exactly occur?. The answer lies in the DNA(Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid). What is this DNA and how does it decide what we are?. Let us dive in. The DNA is made up of four basic blocks A, T, G, and C. Combination of these four give different variations in DNA and define our characteristics. It is like you are given squares, triangles, rectangles and circles and told to stack atop each other randomly(assuming that you are very good at balancing). Some stacks may stay stable, some may fall due to too much instability. If the stacks at too long, then every stable stack will be unique. The same goes with DNA. The A, T, G, and C molecules stack atop each other in double-helix structure. Each structure is unique and thus responsible for unique characteristics in us.

We are Human Beings now, co-existing with around billions of other species on Earth. We have the most complex brains of them all, which allowed us to create all the wonders that you see today. The Pyramids of Egypt,
