	<h1>Earth</h1>
	<p>
		A pale blue dot. Yet an entire Universe in itself. It came into existence 9 billion years after the Big Bang, the birth of The Universe. We have lived here for a long time and have explored this blue dot to its most beauty and immenseness. We adore this blue dot because this blue dot is all we have got. We gaze at other dots in the night sky and mesmerize. Every dot being an entire Universe on its own. We call this blue dot - Our Home, Our Earth. As your life started as a single cell, earth started its life as a bare rock. It was very hot, thousands of degree Celcius. 
<br>
<br>
The history of Earth is full of adventures. So get ready to blow your minds. But don’t worry, we will keep it as simple as possible. It all started with the formation of a regular-sized star - The Sun. The region around the Sun was filled with stardust. This dust moved around the Sun in orbits. They slowly bonded together and formed giant bodies we now call as planets. Okay, that was very straightforward. To demonstrate this, take a paper-board. Pinch a pin in the center of the board. Now, take multiple threads and tie their one end to the pin and other ends to magnets. Place these magnets on the board, separated. Now rotate the board with respect to the pin. Notice how all magnets attract and make a single magnet. Here, the pin is the Sun, threads represent Sun’s gravity and magnetism of magnets represents the gravity of stardust. It is pretty simple. The only difference is that stardust takes thousands of years to join hands because gravity is 10 power 40 times weaker than Electromagnetism!. An easy demonstration is to take a magnet and attach it to some hanging metal object. If gravity was stronger, the magnet would have fallen due to Earth’s gravity but it is not. So, the magnet stays suspended. 
<br>
<br>
We all know that Earth is a planet. But what is a planet?. This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things. First, it must orbit a star. Second, it must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. Third, it must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of similar size near its orbit around the Sun. But this isn't the complete picture. Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula. Planets are formed much like how stars are formed. Hot, dense matter clumps together to form luminous celestial bodies known as Stars. Smaller clumps of matter around these stars form planets. Then why don't planets burn as stars do?. That is because for a celestial body to become a star, it must be at least 80 times more massive than Jupiter ( 1.9x10^27 kg ) to carry out Thermonuclear reactions. That is only 8 percent of our Sun's mass, but it is enough. So planets are 'Failed Stars'.
<br>
<br>
This is how our Earth was formed. It was a hot giant rock at the start. The History of Earth is a combination of both Physics and Chemistry, but largely Chemistry. Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen. All the oxygen was trapped in water molecules in oceans. The galaxies hadn't cooled down that much, space was filled with tiny rocks, which constantly bombarded with Earth. This kept the temperature of Earth hot. Somewhere around that time, a Mars-sized object named Theia bombarded with Earth. This caused large amounts of debris from Earth to scatter into orbit. This debris clumped together to form a celestial body, we know today as - The Moon. Earth now had its own satellite. If Theia had been slighter more massive, it would have scattered the entire Earth into pieces. This might be how other planets got their natural satellites a.k.a. moons. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the formation of a solid crust and allowing liquid water on the surface. The liquid water on Earth is a consequence of its position from the Sun. It lies in a special region called 'The Goldilock Zone' or 'The Habitable Zone', this is a region where temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold, just right enough to allow water to liquify.

The Hadean eon represents the time before a reliable (fossil) record of life; it began with the formation of the planet and ended 4.0 billion years ago. The following Archean and Proterozoic eons produced the beginnings of life on Earth and its earliest evolution. The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic, divided into three eras: the Palaeozoic, an era of arthropods, fishes, and the first life on land; the Mesozoic, which spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs; and the Cenozoic, which saw the rise of mammals. Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale. 
<br>
<br>
There is a very famous theory often correlated with the origin of Life - Abiogenesis. This theory states that life arose from non-life. Definitely, life cannot simply pop into existence. Abiogenesis relates to a period between the Hadeon Eon and the Archean Eon, around 3.8 billion years ago. Life came into existence at this time. Abiogenesis suggests to us that life came into existence from a puddle of chemicals. It is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. While the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes. So, something happened and the simplest form of life was created. What happened?.
<br>
<br>
Elements and compounds essential for life include Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Ammonia, Nitrogen, and Phosphates. For these elements to react and mingle with each other, they need a solvent, in this case, water. And in order to grow and reproduce, they need energy. Life forms are divided into two categories- The Autotrophs and The Heterotrophs. Autotrophs generate their own energy, like plants. Heterotrophs, consume autotrophs to get energy, like us. The first life forms wouldn't have had any other organisms to consume, so they must have been Autotrophs. They might have generated energy from the Sun or a chemical gradient. So which locations on Earth met these criteria?. Places on land or those close to the surface of oceans had the advantage of access to the sunlight. But by the time life began, the UV radiation on Earth's surface was likely too harsh for life to survive there. One set offers protection from this radiation and an alternative energy source - the Hydrothermal Vents that are present across the ocean floors. A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in Earth's crust, where seawater seeps into magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures, along with a rich slurry of minerals and chemical compounds like Iron, Calcium, and Silicon. Energy is particularly concentrated in the steep chemical gradients of hydrothermal vents. There is additional evidence that points to hydrothermal vents, the Last Universal Common Ancestor of life, a.k.a. LUCA. LUCA wasn't the first life form, but it is as far as we can trace. Even so, we don't know what LUCA looked like. There are no LUCA fossils or any modern-day LUCA still around. Instead, scientists identified genes that are commonly found in species across all three domains of life that exist today - Archae, Bacteria, and Eukarya. 
<br>
<br>
Since these genes are shared across all these domains, they must share a common ancestor. These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient, like the ones at hydrothermal vents. There are two kinds of hydrothermal vents, black smokers and white smokers. Black smokers are heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius and release sulphur, iron, copper and other metals essential for life. Black smokers were too hot for LUCA. So, our likely candidates are White Smokers. A field of hydrothermal vents across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge called 'The Lost City' has become the most favored candidate for LUCA. The seawater expelled here is highly alkaline and lacks carbon dioxide, but is rich in Methane and offers more hospitable conditions. Adjacent black smokers may have contributed carbon dioxide that helped life to evolve in the Lost City, giving it all the essential components to support the first organisms that expanded into the incredible diversity of life we see today. 
<br>
<br>
But this does not explain how complex life, such as humans, came into existence. That credit goes to an organism that almost destroyed all life on Earth in its early stages. It caused the first mass extinction in Earth's history and even paved the way for complex life. They are called Cyanobacteria, actually their ancestors. These are single-celled organisms with no organelle, not even nuclei. At that time, the atmosphere was devoid of oxygen. In the oceans, life manifested in the form of tiny Anaerobic organisms. Anaerobic organisms unlike us don't need oxygen to survive. Amongst them were The Cyanobacteria. But somewhere around 2.5 to 3.5 billion years ago, some of them evolved a new ability - Photosynthesis. It allowed them to harness energy using sunlight and allowed them to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and sugars. This gave them an evolutionary advantage over others, and they multiplied in millions. They released the oxygen produced as a by-product into the atmosphere. Soon, the atmosphere was filled with oxygen. Millions of years later, the oxygen gas cloud expanded so much that it started building up in the atmosphere. This was bad news for the anaerobic organisms. Oxygen-rich air was toxic to them. About 2.5 billion years ago, there was a mass extinction of almost all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this the 'Great Oxygenation Event' or the 'Oxygen Catastrophe'. 
<br>
<br>
But there was worse to come. Up until this time, the atmosphere was devoid of the reactive molecule. But as oxygen abundances increased, some of it combined with methane to create carbon dioxide. Methane is a far more efficient greenhouse gas than CO2, and this methane was keeping the planet warm. As levels dropped, the Earth cooled. This triggered a massive glaciation event, a global ice age that locked the planet in its grip. This is called the Huronian Glaciation. Earth was a giant ice ball. Things got so bad the cyanobacteria themselves were threatened. Their own numbers dropped, along with nearly all other life on Earth. The mass extinction that followed was vast. But there was an exception: Some organisms could use that oxygen in their own metabolic processes. Combining oxygen with other molecules can release energy, a lot of it, and that energy is useful. It allowed these microscopic plants to grow faster, breed faster. The anaerobic species died off, falling to the oxygen-burning plants, which prospered in this new environment. Certainly, anaerobes didn’t vanish from the Earth, but they were vanquished to low-oxygen environments such as the bottom of the ocean. They were no longer the dominant form of life on Earth. Eventually, over a few hundred million years, Earth warmed up again, though not as hot. Aerobic organisms absorbed the extra oxygen in the atmosphere over time until it reached a concentration of 21 percent that it is today. And being able to use the chemical power of oxygen, they were able to evolve into more complex forms. Hundreds of million years ago, some other prehistoric microbe swallowed a cyanobacteria whole in a process called Endosymbiosis. It used the cyanobacteria's power of photosynthesis to make its own energy factories. We have learned about them by their name- Chloroplasts. This was the ancestor of our plant cells. Thus, cyanobacteria become chloroplasts. Life as we know now wouldn't exist without Cyanobacteria. So thank them.

That was quite fascinating. How nature works!. The past has been full of amazing natural processes that shaped this pale blue dot into a Universe in itself. But what is a Natural Process in real?. We hear them a lot, but most of us don’t know what it really is. We will dive deep and try to give you a clear insight.
<br>
<br>
Einstein once said - “God doesn’t play dice”. That might be true. But our world does not have any God, nobody plays dice to decide events in the Universe. The Universe plays by Science. Tiny, mindless and stupid things come together to form something meaningful. This is called ‘Emergence’. It describes small things forming bigger things and having different properties than the sum of their parts. Emergence refers to complexity arising from simplicity. This is a property rooted in the Universe and even our Nature. Atoms make molecules, molecules make complex compounds, complex compounds make cells, cells together make organs, organs together make an organism like you. Atoms have no purpose, no desire, they just interact with one another under certain laws of physics. Cells are stupid, they just exchange messages with their neighbors via chemicals. All they know is just how to respond to a particular message. They aren’t aware of themselves. They just do it. There is no Master-mind in the Universe, things just happen. One of the best examples is water. A single water molecule doesn’t do much, just one oxygen atom attached to two hydrogen atoms. But in bulk, they form liquid water, clouds, glaciers, oceans. The Earth is blue because of them. They made us possible. But they never intended to do any of these. In a way, we can say that Chemistry is an emergent property of atomic physics. Biology is an emergent property of Chemistry. Atoms combine with other atoms under the laws of physics. Following these laws, atoms combine to form molecules. We study the interactions of these molecules in Chemistry, and Biology finally studies how collective interactions of a different group of molecules help our body to function. This might not be 100% true, but it is likely to be so. What about physics?. Physics is an emergent property of the fabric of Space-Time and Mathematics helps define relations amongst them. This property of Emergence is present everywhere in the Universe. Life is an emergent property of Nature.
<br>
<br>
All things are in the Universe, and the Universe is in all things: we in it, and it in us; in this way, everything concurs in perfect unity. - Giordano Bruno
<br>
<br>
Our Nature is an emergent property of the Universe. Now, that’s something!. No Master-Controller is controlling the natural processes you see every day, its Emergence. You probably might have heard about the famous ‘Theory of Evolution’ by Darwin. This is a very interesting phenomenon and can be explained with our Emergence property of the Universe very well. Let us dive in. Humans have evolved from monkeys, but if that is true, then why are there monkeys still hopping around?. We see many illustrations of monkeys slowly evolving and ultimately becoming us, the Homo Sapiens. We are not monkeys, we are fish. Monkeys just share a common ancestor with us. We are not the final goal of Evolution; just a by-product of evolution that happened to evolve complex brains. How does evolution work?. Simply, evolution is natural selection; random mutations happen in any species and a new species is born which is slightly better than old ones, they survive while the old ones go extinct just because they were not able to cope up with Nature’s demands. This ‘Natural Selection’ seems some supernatural force governing what is best. But it all boils down to our Emergence property. Mutations occur purely based on laws of Chemistry, but deep within there is still Physics.

Imagine you gave a bunch of toys to a 2-year old kid. These toys are of geometrical shape, circle, triangle, square, and so on. Each piece is identical in dimensions. You want to prepare a square grid, so only square-shaped toys can be used. But telling to do so to a 2-year-old kid is somewhat difficult. So, you let the kid play and nothing of a surprise, the kid places the toys randomly. The kid here is very determined, every time it makes something and if it isn't a square grid that you want, you scatter it. But nonetheless, he or she keeps placing the toys over again. After many such making and scattering loops, the kid starts getting some idea of what you want. Whenever it picks up some non-square toy, it looks at your reaction and starts to realize that picking up only square toys makes you happy and that you won't scatter his play if he or she uses only square toys. So, next time, it uses only square toys to play and enjoys a delicious candy that you gave him or her after finishing the grid. Evolution work almost similar. Random mutations happen in an organism. These mutations may occur due to change in habitat or climate. Some mutations help the organism to survive in this new climate while some make it worse. Mutations can be thought of any changes in the chemical structure of the organism. Different mutations occur in all individuals of a species and those with helpful mutations survive and reproduce while those with bad ones die. But how does this happen?. Think of it like this, a species 
<br>
<br>
We are Human Beings now, co-existing with around billions of other species on Earth. We have the most complex brains of them all, which allowed us to create all the wonders that you see today. The Pyramids of Egypt,
