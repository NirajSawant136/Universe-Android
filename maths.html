		There is a unique trait that we humans have that no animal shares - we talk. We have languages to help us do so. There are around 7000 languages in the world today. We have tremendous diversity in languages rising from all across the globe. The oldest language was probably the ‘Cuneiform Script’ written in the 8th millennium BC, as per current research. But which is the actual oldest language?. Turns out it is Mathematics or simply Maths. We all have heard that Maths is the language of the Universe; that is absolutely true. Maths is universal, 2+2=4 holds true no matter where in the Universe you come from. This universality of Maths has allowed us to devise and prove many theories from Big Bang to Quantum Mechanics. But what is Maths?. Buckle up, it is going to be a heck of a journey!.
<br>
<br>
Let us start from basics, what is the most basic thing you can do with math?. Counting numbers perhaps, you probably learned that in your preschool - 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. You probably weren’t aware of infinity at that time, so life was easy. But what are ‘Numbers’ in the first place?. A number is an abstract thing, it only makes sense when used with physical things. The concept of numbers dates back to prehistoric ages. Our prehistoric ancestors would have had a general sensibility about amounts and would have instinctively known the difference between, say, one and two antelopes. But they had no sense of ‘one’ or ‘two’ or any number, that will take some time. Even today, there are isolated hunter-gatherer tribes in Amazonia which only have words for "one", "two" and "many", and others which only have words for numbers up to five. By why are there exactly 10 basic numbers - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9?. Let us uncover the past. The early humans probably kept count of their members or herds using tags marks.

But as the population increased, this method was no longer helpful and was difficult to keep track of. So, many civilizations came with different notations or symbols to represent the increasing quantities. The most famous amongst them are the Roman Numerals. You probably learned about them. This number system used a different approach; if a numeral appeared before the one with a higher value then it would be subtracted rather than added. But even with this approach, it was a mammoth task to keep account of large numbers like thousands or millions. A better approach lies in something called - The Positional Notation, the method we use today. Earlier for every increasing quantity, people had to make a new symbol. They had to make new symbols for one thousand, one million and so on. But the positional system used selected numbers (in our case, 10) to make a number of any size. Every single-digit number would be given importance based on its position in the sequence. For example, the number 358 signifies 3x10^(2) + 5x10^(1) + 8x10^(0). The exponents(or powers) of 10 represent the positions of 3, 5, and 8 respectively. Thus, the base 10 notation was born. By the 8th century, the Indian mathematicians had perfected the system and it was spread in Europe by traders, scholars, and conquerors. But why specifically 10?. There is no definite reason, but the 10 fingers on each hand and toe might be the reason. This was more or less the history of numbers. But there wasn't any mathematics yet, just mere counting. The base 10 system was used worldwide, but there was another system - base 60. This system was devised by the Babylonian Civilization. Instead of our 10 basic numbers (0-9), they used 60 basic numbers. They could be counted physically using the twelve knuckles, on one hand, the five fingers on the other hand. It has been conjectured that Babylonian advances in mathematics were probably facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 60 - in fact, 60 is the smallest integer divisible by all integers from 1 to 6), and the continued modern-day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle are all testaments to the ancient Babylonian system. It is for similar reasons that 12 (which has factors of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) has been such a popular multiple historically (e.g. 12 months, 12 inches, 12 pence, 2 x 12 hours, etc). The Babylonians also developed another revolutionary mathematical concept, something else that the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans did not have, a circle character for zero, although its symbol was really still more of a placeholder than a number in its own right.

After numbers came 'Geometry'. The earliest geometry was probably brought by the Pre-Dynastic Egyptians and Sumerians in the 5th millennium BCE, as did some megalithic societies in northern Europe in the 3rd millennium BCE or before. They represented geometric designs in their artifacts. But this was more of an art and less of any actual mathematics involved in making these designs. There was no need for any mathematics yet. Mathematics probably initially developed largely as a response to bureaucratic needs when civilizations settled and developed agriculture - for the measurement of plots of land, the taxation of individuals, etc - and this first occurred in the Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations of Mesopotamia (roughly, modern Iraq) and in ancient Egypt. Also, the Sumerians and Babylonians needed to describe quite large numbers as they attempted to chart the course of the night sky and develop their sophisticated lunar calendar. According to some authorities, there is evidence of basic arithmetic and geometric notations on the petroglyphs at Knowth and Newgrange burial mounds in Ireland (dating from about 3500 BCE and 3200 BCE respectively). These utilize a repeated zig-zag glyph for counting, a system that continued to be used in Britain and Ireland into the 1st millennium BCE. Stonehenge, a Neolithic ceremonial and astronomical monument in England, which dates from around 2300 BCE, also arguably exhibits examples of the use of 60 and 360 in the circle measurements, a practice which presumably developed quite independently of the sexagesimal counting system of the ancient Sumerian and Babylonians. We have evidence for the development of a complex system of metrology in Sumer from about 3000 BCE, and multiplication and reciprocal (division) tables, tables of squares, square roots and cube roots, geometrical exercises and division problems from around 2600 BCE onwards. Later Babylonian tablets dating from about 1800 to 1600 BCE cover topics as varied as fractions, algebra, methods for solving linear, quadratic and even some cubic equations, and the calculation of regular reciprocal pairs (pairs of number which multiply together to give 60). One Babylonian tablet gives an approximation to √2 accurate to an astonishing five decimal places!. Others list the squares of numbers up to 59, the cubes of numbers up to 32 as well as tables of compound interest. Yet another gives an estimate for π of 25⁄8 (3.125, a reasonable approximation of the real value of 3.1416 !). The idea of square numbers and quadratic equations naturally arose in the context of the measurement of land, and Babylonian mathematical tablets give us the first-ever evidence of the solution of quadratic equations. The Babylonian approach to solving them usually revolved around a kind of geometric game of slicing up and rearranging shapes, although the use of algebra and quadratic equations also appears. This is truly astonishing, the basic math that we learned in our childhood was made thousands of years ago. We studied primitive mathematics in our school. A lot has happened in these thousands, Math has evolved from
simple to complex and interesting. Over these years, Math has helped us solve many problems, thus allowing us to shape the world we see today.

Let us see how the individual foundations of Math - Addition, Multiplication, and Division came into existence.
